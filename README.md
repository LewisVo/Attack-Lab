# Attack-Lab

### What is this?

* This is lab assignments taken from my course on Programming Systems with [Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective](http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/2e/labs.html) text book in use.  
* The purpose of the Attack Lab is to help students develop a detailed understanding of the stack discipline on x86-64 processors.  It involves applying a total of five buffer overflow attacks on some executable files. There are three code injection attacks and two return-oriented programming attacks.
* __I take no credit on making this possible__ All credit goes to those people who have written the books. Some Solutions are my friends'

### But why ? 

__This is a very hard exercise with few resources on Google or `whatever-web-search-tool` out there, but it is awesome.__

It is so hard at first that I almost cry solving this. However, by solving this you will sharpen your skill in understanding machine code (*Assembly code*).  

> At the end of the series you would've seen how several aspects of a C program are represented in machine code, for example: local variables, registers, conditionals, loops, switch statements, arrays, recursion, structs, etc.    

__Also, this is not where you find solutions to your homework if you are taking an equivalent course at your College, or happen to come accross here by Google search. This is where I provide you with numerous version of the same problem to challenge you. This is not made to compromise the value of the exercise for both instructors and students using CS:APP.__

## Instruction

#### Read the pdf
Read the instruction pdf file. Skip step 1.  

#### And my explanation
You will see more than 30 folders with identical numbers (1551xxx). *Don't panic*. These numbers are my classmates' student IDs. **Each of the folder contains a unique problem**. Although the solving technique is the same for all , this was done to make sure no one can copy others' solutions. **It is therefore very good for you to pratice**.   

My folder is 1551020.
